FACT TABLE AND DIMENSTION TABLE:
____________________________________

1.Repeated values are separated in dimension table.
2.original values are separated in fact table.

* Load the sample data

* Do the duplicate of the sheet

* select 3 columns customer name, customer, address and remove the other columns.
* select the customer name and remove the duplicate values.
* In add column ribbon add the custom index value and change the column name from index to customer_id.
* Again duplicate the main sheet.
* Select item name and item category. Remove the other columns, remove the duplicates and add the index id to item_ID.
* create the separate table for the date. 
* Only have the date column only.
Separate the year, month and day by clicking in the date function in the ribbon.
Again duplicate the main sheet and rename it to fact table. And remove the customer, vegetables details. Only have the numbered data and date column.
Add the customer_id and Item_id in the fact table.
home -> close and apply.
Now model the data. Have the fact table in the centre surrounding by the dimension table.
Star schema (which is fact table is present in the centre and surrounded by the dimension table)


🔁 Summary: Why We Split Data:
	
Reason                  	Benefit
Remove repetition	    Saves space, avoids errors
Easier maintenance	    Change data in one place
Faster queries	            Optimized for joins and filters
More flexible reporting	    Filter by name, category, location
Scales better	            Fact table grows, others stay small



shapes --> Fully cover ->> cut the segment by separating it.-> separate the layout as we want.

Then select the main sheet and select one by one layout and click Merge space -> Substract

Right click it and Format shape -> to reduce transparency
